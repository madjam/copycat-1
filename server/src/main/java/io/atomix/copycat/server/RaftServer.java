/**
 * Provides an interface for managing the lifecycle and state of a Raft server.
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of the Raft server is managed via the {@link Managed} API methods. To start a server,
 * call {@link Managed#open()} on the server. Once the server has connected to the cluster and found
 * a leader, the returned {@link CompletableFuture} will be completed and the server will be operating.
 * <p>
 * Throughout the lifetime of a server, the server transitions between a variety of
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.RaftServer.State states}. Call {@link #state()} to get the current state
 * of the server at any given point in time.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #term()} and {@link #leader()} are critical aspects of the Raft consensus algorithm. Initially,
 * when the server is started, the {@link #term()} will be initialized to {@code 0} and {@link #leader()} will
 * be {@code null}. By the time the server is fully started, both {@code term} and {@code leader} will be
 * provided. As the cluster progresses, {@link #term()} will progress monotonically, and for each term,
 * only a single {@link #leader()} will ever be elected.
 * <p>
 * Raft servers are members of a cluster of servers identified by their {@link Address}. Each server
 * must be able to locate other members of the cluster. Throughout the lifetime of a cluster, the membership
 * may change. The {@link #members()} method provides a current view of the cluster from the perspective
 * of a single server. Note that the members list may not be consistent on all nodes at any given time.
